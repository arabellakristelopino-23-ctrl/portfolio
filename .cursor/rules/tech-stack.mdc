# ==========================================
# PROJECT RULES: TECH STACK & CREATION PLAN
# ==========================================

# TECH STACK
# ----------
# - Must use Next.js 14+ with the App Router.
# - Must use TypeScript for all React components and lib files.
# - Must use Tailwind CSS as the primary styling solution.
# - Must deploy on Vercel (production URL used in README and portfolio).
# - May use:
#   - Framer Motion for animations and section reveals.
#   - Icon libraries (e.g., lucide-react) for UI icons.
#   - shadcn/ui or similar, but styles must match the pink/lavender theme.
# - No real backend or database; portfolio is static / client-side only.

# FILE STRUCTURE RULES
# --------------------
# - Follow the directory layout shown in the "CONCRETE FILE STRUCTURE" tree.
# - All UI/visual components must live under:
#   - components/layout    → shared layout pieces (Header, Footer, MobileNav)
#   - components/sections  → one component per main section (Hero, About, Skills, etc.)
#   - components/ui        → reusable primitives (Button, Card, Badge, SectionTitle, SocialLink)
# - All data-like content must be in:
#   - lib/projects.ts      → project metadata (title, description, tech, links, image)
#   - lib/skills.ts        → skill groups and levels
#   - lib/siteConfig.ts    → site name, tagline, social links, email, etc.
# - Global styling and Tailwind layers must be defined in:
#   - app/globals.css      → imports Tailwind base/components/utilities + custom global styles.

# IMPLEMENTATION PHASES
# ---------------------
# PHASE 0 – INITIAL SETUP
# - Initialize Next.js 14+ app with TypeScript and Tailwind.
# - Create GitHub repo and push initial project.
# - Connect repo to Vercel and verify the starter page builds and deploys.

# PHASE 1 – DESIGN SYSTEM FOUNDATION
# - Configure Tailwind theme with:
#   - Primary colors: pink and lavender/purple variants.
#   - Neutral grayscale for text/background.
#   - Font families for headings and body.
# - Implement base UI primitives:
#   - Button.tsx, Card.tsx, SectionTitle.tsx, Badge.tsx, SocialLink.tsx.
# - Verify these primitives render correctly in a test page or directly in page.tsx.

# PHASE 2 – LAYOUT & NAVIGATION SKELETON
# - Implement <Header /> with:
#   - Desktop navigation links to #hero, #about, #skills, #projects, #contact.
#   - A sticky top bar that stays visible while scrolling.
# - Implement <MobileNav /> with a hamburger toggle on small screens.
# - In app/page.tsx, render all section components in order:
#   - <Hero />, <AboutSection />, <SkillsSection />, <ProjectsSection />, <ContactSection />.
# - Add smooth scrolling behavior for internal nav links.

# PHASE 3 – CONTENT & DATA MODELS
# - Fill lib/siteConfig.ts with:
#   - Site title, your name, tagline, email, GitHub, LinkedIn URLs.
# - Fill lib/skills.ts with grouped skills:
#   - { category: 'Frontend', items: [...] }, etc.
# - Fill lib/projects.ts with at least three project entries:
#   - Title, description, role, tech stack, image path, GitHub link, optional demo link.
# - Connect these data files to SkillsSection and ProjectsSection via props.

# PHASE 4 – SECTION IMPLEMENTATIONS
# - Hero.tsx:
#   - Display your name, role ("Full Stack Developer"), short intro, and CTA buttons.
#   - Include your photo (public/avatar-ara.jpg) with styled frame.
# - AboutSection.tsx:
#   - Display 3–5 paragraphs about your story and CPU background.
#   - Optionally highlight "4th-year Central Philippine University student".
# - SkillsSection.tsx:
#   - Use lib/skills.ts to render skill groups and levels using Card/Badge components.
# - ProjectsSection.tsx:
#   - Map over lib/projects.ts and render project cards with image, tech badges, and buttons.
# - ContactSection.tsx:
#   - Show a friendly CTA text.
#   - Show email button (mailto:...) and social links via SocialLink component.

# PHASE 5 – ANIMATIONS & UX POLISH
# - Integrate Framer Motion (or CSS transitions) to:
#   - Animate hero text and image on load.
#   - Reveal sections as they enter the viewport.
#   - Add hover effects to buttons and cards (subtle scaling + shadow).
# - Add active state styling for nav items based on scroll position (scroll spy behavior).
# - Ensure buttons and links have visible focus states for keyboard navigation.

# PHASE 6 – RESPONSIVE DESIGN & CROSS-DEVICE TESTING
# - Test on common widths: 1920, 1440, 1024, 834, 768, 414, 375.
# - Fix any layout issues:
#   - Overflowing text, images breaking layout, cramped sections on mobile.
# - Ensure:
#   - Tap targets >= 44x44px on mobile.
#   - Text remains readable without zoom.

# PHASE 7 – PERFORMANCE, CLEANUP & FINAL DEPLOY
# - Optimize project images (resize + compress; use Next.js <Image>).
# - Remove dead code, unused imports, and console logs.
# - Run TypeScript and ESLint checks; fix errors and important warnings.
# - Update README.md with:
#   - Project description, tech stack, setup instructions, and live Vercel URL.
# - Trigger final Vercel deployment and confirm:
#   - All sections load correctly.
#   - All links and CTAs work as expected.
