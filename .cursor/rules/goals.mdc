# PROJECT RULES: PORTFOLIO GOALS
# ===============================

# OVERALL PURPOSE
# ---------------
# - This portfolio is a real-world asset to be used for:
#   - Internship applications.
#   - Job applications.
#   - Freelance or side project opportunities.
# - The site must make Ara look:
#   - Professional.
#   - Friendly and approachable.
#   - Focused on UI/UX and full stack web development.

# CONTENT GOALS
# -------------
# - Hero section:
#   - Immediately communicates who Ara is and what she does.
#   - Includes a clear primary call-to-action (e.g., "View Projects" or "Contact Me").
# - About section:
#   - Tells a short but compelling story:
#     - Ara as a 4th-year Central Philippine University student.
#     - How she got into web development.
#     - What she values in UI/UX and full stack work.
# - Skills section:
#   - Clearly shows Ara’s main strengths (UI/UX + web development).
#   - Organizes skills into meaningful categories (Frontend, Backend, Tools, Design).
#   - Gives a rough sense of proficiency (e.g., beginner / intermediate / advanced).
# - Projects section:
#   - Showcases at least 3 meaningful projects.
#   - Each project describes:
#     - What it does and who it’s for.
#     - Ara’s role and the main tech stack.
#     - Links to GitHub and (if possible) live demos.
#   - Visuals (screenshots) are clean, readable, and consistent.
# - Contact section:
#   - Makes it easy to reach Ara via email and social profiles.
#   - Uses clear, friendly microcopy that matches Ara’s casual tone.

# DESIGN & BRANDING GOALS
# -----------------------
# - Visual style:
#   - Cute, jolly, and pastel with a focus on pink and lavender/purple.
#   - No brown in the main color palette.
#   - The design feels fun but not childish—still appropriate for professional use.
# - Typography:
#   - Uses at most 2–3 complementary fonts.
#   - Body text remains easily readable (>= 16px).
#   - Headings create a clear hierarchy and draw attention where needed.
# - Layout:
#   - Uses generous spacing and clear section boundaries.
#   - Feels organized and not cluttered, even on smaller screens.
# - Animations:
#   - Eye-catching but not overwhelming.
#   - Used to support the content (reveals, hover states, subtle movements), not distract.

# UX, RESPONSIVENESS & ACCESSIBILITY GOALS
# ----------------------------------------
# - Navigation:
#   - Simple and intuitive one-page layout with smooth scrolling.
#   - Sticky header so sections are always easy to reach.
#   - On mobile, a hamburger menu provides the same access to sections.
# - Responsiveness:
#   - The site looks good and is easy to use on:
#     - Desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile phones.
#   - No horizontal scrolling on normal viewports.
# - Accessibility:
#   - Text contrast is high enough to be readable over backgrounds.
#   - Images (especially your photo and project screenshots) include alt text.
#   - The site can be navigated with a keyboard (tab focus visible on interactive elements).

# PROFESSIONALISM & QUALITY GOALS
# -------------------------------
# - Code quality:
#   - Clean, consistent, and readable TypeScript + JSX.
#   - Clear component structure (layout vs sections vs ui vs lib).
#   - No obvious unused code or commented-out blocks in the final version.
# - Version control:
#   - Commit history tells a clear story of development, with focused commit messages.
# - Performance:
#   - Page loads quickly enough to feel smooth on typical connections.
#   - Images are optimized; only necessary dependencies are used.
# - Final impression:
#   - A recruiter or teacher visiting the site should:
#     - Understand who Ara is within a few seconds.
#     - Quickly see what Ara can do (skills + projects).
#     - Easily contact Ara if interested in opportunities.
